He also has an incredible eye for detail and a near photographic memory, a skill drilled into him since he was young by his overbearing cop father. It's this ability that enables him to solve crimes just by watching the stories on the news. But as he goes in to pick up his reward check for one such helpful tip, he's hauled into questioning by Detective Lassiter for being in on the crime. No one could have that kind of information and not be on the inside. Backed into a corner, accused of being a partner in the crime, Shawn talks his way out of incarceration by claiming he got the information psychically. Since there's no way to disprove his claim, the police have to let him go.<br></p>",

Henry's friend Ted Archibald, who called them in, is worried they did something wrong during Arthur's Patriarch ceremony.

He's been in the papers lately because he's been trying to prove that the death of wealthy philanthropist William Wyles III was no accident, as was originally thought. He tells Juliet to put out an APB on Hastings' car and goes to leave but Sophie, the assistant curator, insists there's more going on. The alarm was triggered from the inside of the museum and although the security isn't top notch, nowhere on any of the footage does the culprit or the mummy appear. She thinks there's something potentially supernatural going on and she wants the paleosleuth who discovered Zippy the Dinosaur on the case. For once, Lassiter is happy to oblige. So Juliet calls Shawn, who is awake and in the middle taking pictures of a married man having an affair outside a cheesy motel. He finishes that and comes straight down to the museum where he sees fingerprints on the inside of the glass mummy case and footprints leading away from the exit door.

It was the biggest case of Henry's career but Vick stresses that he can in no way be involved in the investigation. Henry's no longer on the force and could compromise any new evidence they find. But by the time Shawn and Gus get back to the Psych office, Henry is there waiting for them and wants in. Shawn refuses. As Henry leaves, he stresses that he knows he got the right guy and stopping him saved a lot of lives.</p>",

As he turned to look, he overheard a guy with curly q's on his face talking to his companion about killing someone with his belt buckle. Obviously, the assassins realized he overheard them, came to kill him and got his super instead.

Despereaux is so good, he's never left enough evidence behind to be formally accused and so promptly gives Shawn and Gus the slip. Shawn goes to the Mounties for help, who need very little convincing of his psychic abilities. Deputy Commissioner Dykstra calls Lassiter to ask for Despereaux's files to be sent up, and Lassiter insists on being part of the investigation. Lassiter and Juliet arrive in Canada just in time to meet Shawn and Gus at Despereaux's latest crime scene. The thief has stolen an antique necklace worth several million dollars.</p>",

Hank explains to them that wooden fence posts around the town have been stolen, someone has poisoned the water and there's a stench in the air that Gus attributes to cat urine.

Shawn quickly notices grey dust on Pete's shoes as the \"body\" is dragged away and wonders what they are doing there.

He got very drunk the night before and when he woke up this morning, a cooler he was transporting for GenuTech was missing. It contained the deadly Thornburg virus, whose symptoms include headache, weakness, and bleeding from the eyes. He also says he is missing an antique gold watch. At that same time, a blonde woman stumbles around a convenience store, then starts bleeding from the eyes before she falls down dead. Shawn and Gus go to the crime scene, where Shawn psychically reveals that the woman died from the Thornburg virus. Shawn also notices the woman is wearing an antique gold watch. If she took Donny's watch, she probably took the cooler, too. They force Donny to remember that he saw tikis last night, which leads them to the Pali Bar. When they get there, the bartender immediately recognizes Donny, and tells them he left with a hot blonde named Ginger. Shawn figures Donny took her back to his room, and when they get there, Shawn sees clues leading him to conclude Ginger was a prostitute, who targeted Donny in order to rob him. Juliet calls Shawn to tell him he was right about the woman dying of Thornburg. She is at the victim's apartment now, where they discovered ten thousand dollars in cash but no cooler. She also tells Shawn she found a key to a hotel room, which is a few doors down from Donny's room. Shawn figures out that someone hired Ginger to rob Donny, and that person was holed up in the other room. The guys sneak in and find an empty box of latex gloves and a map to Jay's Java Shack. Shawn realizes the mastermind plans to release the virus there. They rush over and meet the cops there, but just before they enter, Shawn sees a broken vile and bars the doors to anyone going in or out. Their only choice now is to contain the outbreak.</p>",

The next morning, Lassiter and Juliet are at the beach where the body of what appears to be a shark attack victim has washed ashore. Lassiter thinks he sees what might be a knife wound among the shark bites. He sees Shawn and Gus approach, and, determined not to be outdone this time, beats Shawn to the punch, claiming to the press that the victim was murdered. The reporters crucify him, but Shawn is on board with his theory, having spotted the possible knife wound himself. They all go to the coroner, who says he can't identify the victim off of fingerprints since the fingers are still in the shark, along with the victim's wallet. Lassiter says he'll put out a bulletin for anyone who catches a shark so they can at least identify the man, but Shawn still pushes the murder angle. The coroner says he can't rule out a stab wound but the knife used would have been jagged, like a tooth. Now Lassiter is more determined to find the shark in order to ID the victim and start tracking down his killer.</p>",
